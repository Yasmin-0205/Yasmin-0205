* Wet and Dry code 

- Indentation is very important, and its written that a number of spaces in the indentation should be 4 
- Reading and writing follow accepted conventions to make tasks easier  
- Keep it Simple (KISS) 

 
DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself 
WET - Waste Everyone's Time/Write Everything Twice/We Enjoy Typing 


DRY Code 
- This is capturing the rules of the real world in computer code 
- In database design it captures the structure of the real world 
- In UX/UI design it captures the interactions of the real world 
- In networking it captures the connectivity of the real world in the infrastructure of design 
 

Methodology 
- Understand the problem 
- Take a very small part of the problem and solve it 
- Repeat until all the parts are solved 
- Combine the solutions of the sub problems into the whole problem
