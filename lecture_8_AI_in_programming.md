What is GitHub Copilot? 
- AI is a pair programmer that can suggest code, comments and test code 
-- It's best used as an assistant - you should always review and double check (run) the code provided 

 

How does Copilot fit your workflow? 
- Can complete lines and whole functions as you type 
- Can generate tests, docstrings and examples 
- Treat suggestions as an initial draft (and review carefully) 

- Asking Copilot to write tests 
- Debug with Copilot 
- Refactoring suggestions 

DON'T tell Copilot any passwords or secret data - it will be stored/exposed 

 

Licensing & attribution 
- Generated code may resemble public sources. 
- Check the licensing rules and follow policies before reuse 


ChatGPT was seen as a threat to Universities academic integrity when it first appeared 

 

 

The current use of AI is increasing in the computing sector 

However, good use depends on high levels of distrust 

Therefore we still need developers who can program as AI is still very unreliable 

A mindset is required to use Copilot or your peers as opposed to Googling the answers 

 

Prompt engineering - knowing what to ask AI 

Developers must speak the language of the issue in order to be asking the right questions 

 

 

Code generally is read more than it is written. 
Now some of the reading is being done with AI 

This emphasises the importance of choosing suitable identifiers and well-structured code and potentially even comments 



* Using AI is not cheating. 
** Cheating using AI is cheating, and very easy to spot.
