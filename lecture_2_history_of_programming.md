* Programming History 

Computers are good at carrying out repetitive tasks.  
  - They are accurate, fast, ad can work for long periods of time without getting tired 
  - Humans on the other hand are bad at carrying out repetitive tasks, getting bored, tired and making mistakes 


A programmable computer carries out a specific task very accurately and quickly has its uses 
  - However if we program it to different tasks, then we can use the same computer for many different purposes, making it more useful 


First Generation Programming 
  - Involves physically altering the computer 
  - Colossus was programmed using plugs and switches, representing a very early form of program 
  - Early programming was very low-level and very specific to the hardware 

 

Second Generation Programming 
  - Programming moved to a higher level with the introduction of assembly languages. This can be thought of short codes that correspond to the computers basic operations 
    - Assembly languages are still very low-level  and specific to the CPU. 
       -  They're not portable between different computers using different CPUs 
  
   


Third Generation Programming 
  - Expressed in a more human-friendly format 
      - Implies the need for tools to translate a program into the low level instructions of the CPU 
      - Using these tools means that programs can be written that are portable between computers 
  - Some languages focus on speed (C and C++) and some on safety (Rust) 
  - Some languages follow the object-oriented paradigm (Java, C#), some are functional (Haskell, Scala) and some are procedural(C, Pascal) 
      - Some languages are multi-paradigm like Python 

 


Compilers and Interpreters 
  - There are 2 distinct ways to translate high-level language into low-level instructions 
      - Compilers - translates the entire program into ow-level instructions (stored in a separate file) before it is run 
          - These programs tend to execute very quickly, but the compilation step can take a long time 
      - Interpreters - translates the program into low-level instructions as it runs. The instructions are executed immediately, so there's no separate file 
          - Tends to execute more slowly, but the translation step is very quick 
  - Python, PHP, and JavaScript are examples of interpreted languages 

 


Why python? 
  - Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming languages
